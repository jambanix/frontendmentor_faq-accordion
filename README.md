## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

This was my first time using Javascript. I learned how to make an accordion and what tabindex is, and how to cycle through it using the arrow keys.

### Continued development

I would like to make a more "flashy" accordion by having it transition in instead of appearing instantly.
